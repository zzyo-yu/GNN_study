# RecBole-GNN

![](asset/recbole-gnn-logo.png)

-----

**RecBole-GNN** is a library built upon [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) and [RecBole](https://github.com/RUCAIBox/RecBole) for reproducing and developing recommendation algorithms based on graph neural networks (GNNs). Our library includes algorithms covering three major categories:
* **General Recommendation** with user-item interaction graphs;
* **Sequential Recommendation** with session/sequence graphs;
* **Social Recommendation** with social networks.

## Highlights

* **Easy-to-use and unified API**:
    Our library shares unified API and input (atomic files) as RecBole.
* **Efficient and reusable graph processing**:
    We provide highly efficient and reusable basic datasets, dataloaders and layers for graph processing and learning.
* **Extensive graph library**:
    Graph neural networks from widely-used library like [PyG](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric) are incorporated. Recently proposed graph algorithms can be easily equipped and compared with existing methods.

## Requirements

```
recbole>=1.0.0
pyg>=2.0.4
pytorch>=1.7.0
python>=3.7.0
```

## Quick-Start

With the source code, you can use the provided script for initial usage of our library:

```bash
python run_recbole_gnn.py
```

If you want to change the models or datasets, just run the script by setting additional command parameters:

```bash
python run_recbole_gnn.py -m [model] -d [dataset]
```

## Result

### Leaderboard

We carefully tune the hyper-parameters of the implemented models of each research field and release the corresponding leaderboards for reference:

- **General** recommendation on `MovieLens-1M` dataset [[link]](results/general/ml-1m.md);
- **Sequential** recommendation on `Diginetica` dataset [[link]](results/sequential/diginetica.md);
- **Social** recommendation on `LastFM` dataset [[link]](results/social/lastfm.md);

### Efficiency

With the sequential/session graphs preprocessing technique, as well as efficient GNN layers, we speed up the training process of our sequential recommenders a lot.
